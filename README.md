# Drone-Delivery-Service

## Description
A company wants to establish a drone service to deliver packages from city to city. Your
task is to implement algorithms to help them plan the set of flights that will be needed to make
sure packages can be delivered from every city to every other city they serve while minimizing
flight distances. The file cities.xlsx contains the names of the cities to be served and the flight
distance from each pair of cities from which it is feasible to fly a drone; if flying a drone between
two cities is not feasible, the distance appears as -1. For example, the “drone distance” from El
Paso to Austin is 851, from Dallas to Las Vegas it’s 1700, and it is not feasible to fly a drone
from Laredo to San Antonio.

## Installation
